### What is MetroVlc Schedule?
MetroValencia Schedule (or MVS) is a public API which returns data from [MetroValencia](http://www.metrovalencia.es) relative
to Valencia (Spain) subway system like stations codes or train schedule.

### Why I've developed MetroVlc Schedule?
I'm a regular user of the subway and I'm tired to enter in [MetroValencia](http://www.metrovalencia.es) to see when the next
train comes in a horrible table. My first idea was to take the data and build a new website, responsive and with modern UI;
but then I thought that if I could get the data, why not make this data public and let everyone to use it?

### How can I use MetroVlc Schedule?
It's easy, just go to the [documentation](documentation) page and take a look, you will see that's easy to use.

### Notes
- All data comes from the official website of [MetroValencia](http://www.metrovalencia.es).
- For that reason if [MetroValencia](http://www.metrovalencia.es) is down, MVS won't work.
- MVS won't store any data that comes from the client.
- The code can be found [in Github](https://github.com/legomolina/MetroVlcSchedule).
- MVS is licensed under [GPL v3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html) so feel free to fork it and improve it.
